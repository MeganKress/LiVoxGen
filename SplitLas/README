Running SplitLas

Prerequisites: The following library must be installed. It can
		be installed through Synaptic Package Manager.
		
	libLAS: http://www.liblas.org/


1. Make SplitLas Executable
	In Terminal:
		cd /path/to/VoxGen/SplitLas
		sudo make

2. Run MinMaxZ on Individual File

	A. Navigate to SplitLas directory.
	
	B. In terminal:
		./SplitLas /path/to/file.las TileSize
	
	   Note: TileSize can be an int or double indicating
		 the side length of each square tile in meters.

	C. Result:
		For a LAS file "file.las," separate LAS files of
		the form "file_index.las" will be created in the 
		directory containing the initial file.


3. Run MinMaxZ on a Directory Containing LAS Files
	
	A. Navigate to the directory in which the LAS files are
	   located.

	B. In terminal:
		/path/to/VoxGen/Scripts/SLindFile TileSize

	   Note: TileSize can be an int or double indicating
		 the side length of each square tile in meters.

	C. Result:
		For a LAS file "file.las," separate LAS files of
		the form "file_index.las" will be created in the 
		directory containing the initial file.

4. Purpose:
	VoxGen runs more efficiently with smaller LAS files. Split
	each LAS file into tiles (remove initial unsplit LAS files),
	divide the split LAS files into 3 or 4 separate directories using
	/VoxGen/Scripts/divIntoDir, and then run the script "VGindFile" 
	on each directory simultaneously.
