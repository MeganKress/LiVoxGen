Running MinMaxZ

Prerequisites: The following libraries must be installed. Both
		can be installed through Synaptic Package Manager.
		
	- libLAS: http://www.liblas.org/
	- Boost: http://www.boost.org/


1. Make MinMaxZ Executable
	In Terminal:
		cd /path/to/VoxGen/MinMaxZ
		sudo make

2. Run MinMaxZ

	A. Navigate to MinMaxZ directory.
	
	B. In terminal:
		./MinMaxZ /directory/containing/multiple/las/files

	C. Result:
		range.txt file will be created in the directory 
		used as an argument. The format of the file will be
		as follows:

			MinX = 736400
			MaxX = 742568

			MinY = 7.13646e+06
			MaxY = 7.14164e+06

			MinZ = 215.77
			MaxZ = 266.71

3. Purpose:
	The MinZ and MaxZ arguments can be used in the VoxGenPar parameter
	file next to "zmin" and "zmax" if one wishes to run VoxGen on a 
	number of LAS files and maintain consistent vertical voxels.
